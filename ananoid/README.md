Ananoid
===

Ananoid provides nano identifiers, an alternative to UUIDs. This project was
inspired by https://github.com/ai/nanoid.

### Overview

A nano identifier, or nanoid, is a randomly generated opaque value, suitable
for uniquely identifying database entries, file names, et cetera.

Ananoid (pronounced: "an-an-oyd") is a library for generating such identifiers.
It uses cryptographically secure random number generation, and has no
dependencies beyond the dotnet 6 base class libraries. It has both a high-level
API, and a simpler, more memory-efficient, low-level API.
